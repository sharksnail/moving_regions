# moving_regions

In this project a web application was developed to upload data about moving regions. 
These are stored in the MongoDB database. This allows any user to use the moving regions for temporal analysis.

The data is in Nested List Notation and is converted to a JSON file.
The project will continue as an open source project, so anyone can add extensions and also make changes.

So far, the functions for temporal display, temporal filter and location-based filter have been implemented. 
In addition, the upload and download of the objects was implemented.
